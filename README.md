# graphql-schema-cycles-webapp
This repo contains the code of a Web application that allows users to analyze their GraphQL schemas in terms cycles in the network of relationships between types. For the actual detection and enumeration of such cycles, the application uses our [graphql-schema-cycles
library](https://github.com/LiUGraphQL/graphql-schema-cycles).
